Open PetersonSpencerAssignment1.m in Matlab. Preferably using R2021a. You can run the entire program at once or run each cell individually in order. 
The first cell creates a simple exponential function.
The second cell interpolates using a Vandermonde matrix
The third cell interpolates using two given function that must be in the working directory. Barylag and polyinterp. 
The fourth cell interpolates using MATLAB's built in PCHIP
The fifth cell prints all of the norms calculated in the previous cells in a form for LaTeX.
The sixth cell creates figures for the error and time for each of the algorithms run in the earlier cells.
The seventh cell runs interpolation on weather data contained in the files ud, zd, zp-1.
The eighth cell defines a function to print the norms.
